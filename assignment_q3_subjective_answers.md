- In this question I have implemented the Autograd version of the Gradient Descent Algorithm using the module AutoGrad.

- When fit_intercept is set to True, a new column is of 1s is added to the dataset which incorporates the theta-0 in our fitting.

+ Results: 

## fit_intercept = True
### RMSE:  0.9537783331135721
### MAE:  0.7549816734443021
.
## fit_intercept = False
### RMSE:  0.9490180259603621
### MAE:  0.7685933611447563
