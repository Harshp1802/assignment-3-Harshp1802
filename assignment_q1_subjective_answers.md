- In this question I have implemented the non-Vectorised version of the Gradient Descent Algorithm.

- When fit_intercept is set to True, a new column is of 1s is added to the dataset which incorporates the theta-0 in our fitting.

+ Results: 

## fit_intercept = True
### RMSE:  0.9722692292306397
### MAE:  0.7739366991456492
.
## fit_intercept = False
### RMSE:  0.912359080002424
### MAE:  0.7143683264366153
